# Implemented, Needs Debugging/Testing

- On colonize(), after claiming controller, _.set() spawn_room and spawn_route.



# To Implement

- Creep ability to request another creep to move/swap spaces
	- If burrower blocked from source, request blocking creep to swap spaces

- Automatic placement of structures...
	- Take RCL 8 base layout... 
		`if (Game.room.rmColony.find(FIND_MY_STRUCTURES, filter: structureType).length < CONTROLLER_STRUCTURES.structureType[Game.room.rmColony.controller.level]` ... then build up to max of 5 construction sites. Go in order of importance (spawn, extension, tower, storage, etc... process extractor, link, and containers seperate, not based on base layout)
	- Won't need blueprint functionality afterwards...
