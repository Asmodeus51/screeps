** My rooms...




** To do **

- Combat code:
	1) Problem: soldiers rushing into room, get out of range of healers, die.
		- Option for soldiers and healers to pair off, only move together- ratio 1:2?
	2) Problem: tower attacking when insufficient to damage through healers (wasting energy)
		- Tower code assess all enemies in room for heal parts, calculate efficacy before attacking
	3) Defensive soldiers being spawned through load-balancing spawn code (spawning in other rooms!)
		- Duplicate spawn_request for defensive soldier in home room with load-balancing disabled
			- Note: cannot entirely disable load-balancing, or else low-RCL rooms (or new room without spawn) will not spawn defense
	4) In-room energy distribution (tower filling, spawn filling) mediocre under siege
		- Towers wasting energy! Add spawn_request for additional carriers (ideally load-balanced)

- Storage targets: Minimum targets for mineral storage should be 25k XGHO2, XKHO2, XLHO2, XZHO2, XUH2O per room
		
- Option for colony to *only* spawn remotely (string flag in array listSpawnRooms?)
	
- Overloads 
	- room.resource(resource) return terminal + storage if has resource?
	- room.nuker
	- room.observer

- Implement:
	- Safe Mode... argh
	- Observer
	- Power spawn?

- Optimization

	- _.groupBy for runPopulations
	- moveTo optimization?
		if(creep.moveTo(StartRoomFlag, {reusePath: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER}) != OK) {
			creep.moveTo(StartRoomFlag,{reusePath:0, ignoreCreeps:true})
		}


		
	
	
** Fixed? Needs Testing? **

	- Memory.rooms.undefined.tasks_running.undefined keeps getting set??!?


	
	
	
	
	
** Bugs **

- CPU Profiler
	- room_cycles always equals cycles in Math.max(room_cycles, cycles)
	

	
	
	
	
** Ideas **
	
- Attack Optimizations
	- Towers to target flank/outside creeps, possibly creeps not near healers?
	
* Optimization
	- Task system
		... done? new ideas?
